### Hi there 👋

😁 My name is [Robson Costa](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robson-costa-68057055/) and i´m researcher and professor at [IFSC (Federal Instititute of Santa Catarina)](https://www.ifsc.edu.br) on south of Brazil.<br>
🏫 I´m also director of [AgroTechLab](https://agrotechlab.lages.ifsc.edu.br), a laboratory that develop IoT based technologies for agribusiness.<br>
🌐 In this context, i´m the initiator of TTN community in the Lages city ([TTN/Lages](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/community/lages/)).<br><br>

🏢 As this is my private account on GitHub, here are private repositories of works i have done for some companies as well as [Controlle Innovation Ltda](https://github.com/controlle-innovation), which i´m co-founder.<br>
🌱 I also have an institutional GitHub account ([here](https://github.com/robsoncosta-ifsc)), but all the repositories i work in are allocated at [AgroTechLab](https://github.com/AgroTechLab-IFSC).<br>
👯 Most repositories at this last account are public and follow open source or open hardware licenses.<br><br>

Currently i act as IoT Solutions Architect, defining technologies to be used, since the hardware, passing through the firmware and all communication protocols until the bussiness layer with mobile and web applications.<br>
I love programming and the languages ​i usually use are C and C++. For some specific works i use Python, Dart, JScript and Java.<br>
Lately i've been using VSCode as a programming environment. But as i have already worked in the R&D department of a multinational industry, i have already worked with Eclipse, IAR and Keil. In addition, I have also worked with the Zilinx IDE.<br>
I've worked on both bare metal projects and RTOS projects (MQX and FreeRTOS).
